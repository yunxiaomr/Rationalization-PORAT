# 🧩 Learnable Game-theoretic Policy Optimization for Data-centric Self-explanation Rationalization

**Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE) [paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13393)**

🚀 *Code is coming soon!*



## 📘 Overview


We provide:

* ✅ Fine-tuning **settings** (`.yaml` configuration file)
* ✅ Well-constructed **dataset and metadata** (`dataset_info.json`)

You can directly use these files in Llama-Factory to reproduce the  **Fact Decomposition LLM** .
